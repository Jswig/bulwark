Installation
============

```bash
pip install bulwark
```

or

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge bulwark
```

Note that the latest version of Bulwark will only be compatible with newer version of Python, Numpy, and Pandas. This is to encourage upgrades that themselves can help minimize bugs, allow Bulwark to take advantage of the latest language/library features, reduce the technical debt of maintaining Bulwark, and to be consistent with Numpy's community version support recommendation in [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html). See the table below for officially supported versions:

| Bulwark | Python |  Numpy |  Pandas  |
|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|
|  0.6.0  |  >=3.6 | >=1.15 | >=0.23.0 |
| <=0.5.3 |  >=3.5 |  >=1.8 | >=0.16.2 |
|         |        |        |          |
